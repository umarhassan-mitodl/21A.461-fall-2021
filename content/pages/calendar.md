## Introduction

**Session 1: Intro: What Is Capitalism? What Is Anthropology? How Can Understanding Capitalism Help Us Better Understand Our Current Historical Moment?**

*Class discussion suggests what an anthropological take on capitalism might look like, how this approach potentially differs from those of other disciplines, and what it might help us understand about the economic system with which we are all enmeshed.*

**Session 2: Expanding Inequality and Contemporary Crises**

*Class discussion focuses on a key topic in debates over contemporary capitalism: expanding economic inequality. What is the evidence for it? What are the various perspectives on how to understand it and its implications? The readings illustrate the two kinds of materials this class will use to approach various topics. Piketty’s overarching theoretical discussion of growing inequality is juxtaposed with an ethnographic example of what growing inequality “felt like” from the point of view of a deindustrializing community.*

**Session 3: Thinking about Capitalism and Information Ecologies I**

*Class unit that explores the power of shifting information ecosystems to shape how we are informed - or disinformed - about contemporary capitalism.*

**Session 4: Thinking about Capitalism and Information Ecologies II**

*Continued discussion of information ecologies (and the economics underpinning them). Offers practical guidance on how to navigate information sources and determine more trustworthy sources when writing final papers.*

## Theories of Capitalism

**Session 5: Nineteenth-Century Political Economy**

*Class discussion gives overview of key ideas of Adam Smith and Karl Marx, locating their ideas within their historical time periods and acknowledging the complexity of their ideas in ways that critics and advocates often gloss over. Students are randomly assigned to espouse the ideas of either Adam Smith or Karl Marx in a class debate on the virtues and pitfalls of capitalism.*

**Session 6: Capitalism and “Culture”**

*Offers overview of key ideas of well-known sociologists/anthropologists and the ways they sought to address the role of “culture” and belief within economic accounts of capitalism.*

**Session 7: Debating Capitalism after World War II**

*Looks at two influential European theorists who experienced both WWI and WWII. Although coming from similar backgrounds, Polanyi and Hayek espoused diametrically opposed understandings of capitalism that would become highly influential after WWII.*

**Session 8: Globalized Capitalism and Racial Capitalism**

*Explores additional social theories regarding how to understand capitalism, including the economic dynamics underpinning “globalization” as well as how racial difference has been historically central to the emergence of capitalism.*

**Session 9: How We Got to the Extremes: From the Precariat to the Superwealthy**

*Examines yet other contemporary theories of capitalism, including ideas relating to post-structuralism and precarity. Continues to explore the need to think globally through an historical account of “off-shoring.”*

Assignment due: Essay 1

## An Ethnographic Look: Capitalism and Everyday Life

**Session 10: Exploring Social Class in High School**

*This new unit highlights ethnographic accounts of capitalism. It begins by exploring how social class is embedded in everyday social realities in ways we don’t always examine – including in interactions among teenage girls in a California high school.*

*Discussion of the shifting demographics, cultural lifestyles, and beliefs of the super wealthy as well as the economic transformations underpinning this shift.*

**Session 12: Race, Class, and Status**

*Ethnographic account of middle- and upper-middle class suburban Black Americans living outside Washington, D.C. Explores the intersection of class and racial dynamics.*

**Session 13: Losing Industrial Jobs**

*Ethnographic accounts of daily life experiences of job loss and growing precarity in former working-class industrial regions in the United States. Considers how experiences of deindustrialization vary between different parts of the world.*

**Session 14: The Rise of the “Fissured Workplace”**

*Theoretical account of how and why corporations have “fissured” and what that means for working conditions. Weil’s analysis is juxtaposed with journalistic accounts of the work lives of fast food employees and recent immigrant workers in the United States.*

**Session 15: Chasing an Innovation Economy: Gig Work, Robots, and Artificial Intelligence**

*Explores the transformation in the nature of work associated with the rise of the gig economy through ethnographic discussions of AI “ghost workers” in the United States and India as well as of Uber drivers in the United States and Canada.*

Assignment due: Essay 2 

## Capitalism and Its Others

**Session 16: Soviet-Style State Socialism**

*Ethnographic account of how economic life and state surveillance played out in the daily experience of ordinary people in the Soviet Union and its satellites just before its fall.*

Assignment due: Final paper topics

**Session 17: The Nordic Model**

*Journalistic account of social and economic policies across differing Nordic countries and how such policies contrast with those elsewhere. Considers how the term “socialism” confusingly gets used to describe vastly different social and economic set-ups.*

**Session 18: The View from Post-Colonial Regions**

*Looks at international Marxist movements after decolonization through an ethnographic exploration of the difficult history of the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution. Considers how “Marxism” in the region bore little resemblance to assumptions of either Western supporters or critics, suggesting the importance of deep dives into the histories of particular locations.*

Assignment due: Final paper outlines

**Session 19: Varieties of “Welfare” States**

*Explores how the social policies of ‘welfare states’ take different forms among wealthy countries, and how such policies have been impacted by the changing nature of both contemporary capitalism and political movements. Discussion grounded through an ethnographic account of Japan.*

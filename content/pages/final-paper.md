Please write a 10-page double-spaced essay on a topic of your choosing that relates to contemporary capitalism, and that highlights interactions among economic, social, and political dynamics. Below is a list of possible topics, but feel free to choose something entirely different. (If you’re stuck, many students in years past explored different aspects of the 2008 financial crisis which still offers a wealth of interesting possibilities; also see possible topics on this below.)

For whichever topic you choose, consider yourself an anthropologist/ethnographer. Although you won’t be able to conduct fieldwork on the topic, try to think about the social dimensions of the problem and how it plays out in everyday life. Try to locate information that helps elucidate those dimensions. For example, if a topic is one that is heavily debated, consider some of the following questions: What are the range of actors involved in this issue? How are they positioned in relation to each other in social, economic, or political terms? Why do different groups take different positions on this issue and what is at stake for them? What ideas or moral and ethical arguments do they make/offer on behalf of their position? What economic or policy-oriented arguments?

If your topic explores a particular issue or dimension of an issue rather than focusing on competing viewpoints, different questions might be appropriate. Even so, try to go beyond just the “ideas” to consider why such ideas are compelling for particular categories of people. What is going on in social, economic, and political terms that might cause such ideas to have wider salience? In analyzing the viewpoints of various actors in your paper, include an attempt to make sense of the social, economic, and moral logics at work for those actors, even if one disagrees with their viewpoints. In addition, your thesis should encompass your own perspective on the issue that emerges from what you have learned in writing the paper and which may also link back to some of the broader discussions/debates we have had in class about how to understand the nature of capitalism.

In your paper, you must cite two to three of the class readings that you have not cited in previous papers. (If you would like to substitute others, please confer with the instructor.)

In addition to readings cited from class, you will be expected to cite a minimum of 4–5 other sources offering competing viewpoints on the topic and based on respected sources where you know where the information is coming from. These should include academic works but may also include media pieces, particularly for topics that have happened too recently to be thoroughly explored in the academic literature. Cite work that offers different perspectives/controversy on a topic. (For example, if you cite media articles, perhaps pair the {{% resource_link "4ceab8f5-bfe8-4cad-8a00-8d458dfd3452" "New York Times" %}} and the {{% resource_link "90edd6ea-4b6b-4493-b27e-49fe110e05ae" "Wall Street Journal" %}}; the {{% resource_link "4617d24a-810a-4b45-9fee-65cf41666ca9" "Economist" %}} and the {{% resource_link "416e6c0f-8ac5-4d50-9f1f-8bf235f80ebd" "New York Review of Books" %}}; or the Weekly Standard and the {{% resource_link "eeb2409e-1308-4e5e-b082-f218aa1456ab" "Nation" %}}. See {{% resource_link "f18763fc-480d-4460-96ad-f1a1cd2569cd" "“Things to Think About When Using Media Sources” (PDF)" %}} for suggestions.)

Regarding academic citations, the instructor will offer suggestions on academic work that might be relevant to your topic. Although you may reference work from different academic disciplines, keep in mind that the orientation of this paper is primarily one that focuses on social analysis (i.e. exploring how a particular topic plays out for particular categories of people in their day-to-day lives or has other kinds of social impacts, i.e. the kind of “ethnographic” analysis we have discussed in class), rather than statistical, economic, or policy analysis per se.

A proposed paper topic and possible sources will be due during session 16. An outline with an annotated bibliography will be due during session 18 (i.e. a bibliography of sources you plan to use with a sentence describing what’s in that particular source and how it relates to your topic). The first draft of your paper is due during session 21, and the final version is due during session 25. During the last two classes, each student will also give a 5–10 min. oral presentation on their final paper topic. Each student will be required to meet with the writing advisor for feedback on their paper draft as it is developed.
